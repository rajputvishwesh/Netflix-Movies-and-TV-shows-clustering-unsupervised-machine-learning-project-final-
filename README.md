Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering using Unsupervised Machine Learning
This project aims to cluster the movies and TV shows available on Netflix using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Almabetter

Project Overview
The project involves the following main steps:

Data Preprocessing: The raw dataset contains a lot of missing and incorrect values. Therefore, the first step is to preprocess the data and remove any duplicates, irrelevant features, and missing values.

Feature Engineering: The next step is to engineer new features that can be used for clustering. Some of the features engineered in this project include movie duration, movie and TV show release year, and the total number of seasons for TV shows.

Data Visualization: Once the data is preprocessed and feature engineered, it is important to visualize the data to gain insights and select appropriate features for clustering.

Model Selection: In this project, we have selected the K-Means algorithm for clustering. We have experimented with different values of K and evaluated the performance of the algorithm using different metrics.

Model Evaluation: We have used several metrics to evaluate the performance of the K-Means algorithm. These include the Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index.

Visualization of Clusters: Finally, we have visualized the clusters using different types of plots, such as scatter plots, 3D plots, and heat maps.

Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries to be installed:

Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
You can install all these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly

Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Download the dataset from Kaggle and save it in the data directory.

Open the netflix_clustering.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, engineer new features, and cluster the movies and TV shows.

Run the cells in the notebook to visualize the data and evaluate the performance of the K-Means algorithm.

Generate the visualizations of the clusters and analyze the results.

Conclusion
In this project, we have successfully clustered the movies and TV shows available on Netflix using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The results of the clustering can be used to recommend movies and TV shows to users based on their preferences. Future work can include implementing other clustering algorithms and evaluating their performance on this dataset.
